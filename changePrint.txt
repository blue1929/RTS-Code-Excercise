I wish I could remove the separate use of System.out.println and System.out.print.

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
  
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Favourite 1");
  
        System.out.println("Favourite 2");
    }
}

This will print the output in two separate lines. 

import java.util.*;
import java.io.*;
  
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.print("Favourite 1");
  
        System.out.print("Favourite 2");
    }
}

This will print the output in altogther in single line which can be done using a concatenation. 


This two lines could have been used as one output statement. So if I use two separate statement blocks
then it should print it in two lines. If needed to be printed in one line then can be done as one line  

        System.out.print("Favourite 1" + "Favourite 2") instead of
   
        System.out.print("Favourite 1");
  
        System.out.print("Favourite 2");

For the System.out.print we can concatenate. So the println from System.out.println can be removed and System.out.print be used as more generic;
